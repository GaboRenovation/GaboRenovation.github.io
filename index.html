          <h4>_________________________________________________________________</h4>
          <P>In a recent document of the Medical News Today, the belly button is home to many bacteria but can be overlooked when a person washes. Mostly, the bacteria are harmless, but they can multiply and cause an infection. We find out what might cause a belly button to smell, and how to keep it clean and healthy.</P>
          <h4>_________________________________________________________________</h4>
          <h5>Fast facts on belly button smell:</h5> 
          <b>Infection</b> 
          <p>A fungal infection can result if belly button bacteria multiply too much</p>
          <b>Hygiene</b> 
          <p>Belly button skin needs to be cleaned regularly to keep it healthy.</p>
          <b>Smell</b> 
          <p>Risk factors, such as poor hygiene, increase the potential for the belly button to smell.</p>
          <h4>_________________________________________________________________</h4>
          <p>Most belly buttons are indented so act as a trap for sweat, dead skin, and dirt. Few people wash the belly button with soap so germs can develop.

            The most common cause for a belly button smell is poor hygiene. All areas of the body need to be washed regularly to stay clean and healthy.
            
            Skin is home to trillions of bacteria, which develop naturally and are usually harmless.
            
            The belly button has folds of skin that provide a place for bacteria to grow. Most of these bacteria remain at a low level and will not cause a smell. But if bacteria become too dense, they may result in an unpleasant or offensive smell.
            
            Any infection should be checked by a doctor, and medication and lifestyle changes may be needed.</p>
